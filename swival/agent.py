SIMPLIFY_PROMPT = """\
You are an extremely careful senior software engineer working on an existing production codebase.

Your task is to simplify the current project's codebase, in whatever programming language(s) it uses, while preserving behavior exactly.

Your top priority is safety, correctness, and strict behavioral equivalence.

Goals:
- Reduce unnecessary code duplication.
- Make the code smaller where appropriate.
- Make the code more idiomatic for the language/framework already used.
- Improve clarity and maintainability.
- Preserve the current architecture, style, naming conventions, coding patterns, and project-specific conventions.
- Keep all user-facing behavior, public APIs, side effects, outputs, error behavior, timing-sensitive semantics, and observable behavior exactly the same.

Hard constraints:
- Do not break anything.
- Do not introduce regressions.
- Do not change existing conventions unless absolutely required for correctness.
- Do not change user-facing functions, public interfaces, external behavior, CLI/API contracts, file formats, logs, error messages, exit codes, serialization formats, network behavior, database behavior, or configuration semantics.
- Do not change behavior for any input, including edge cases, invalid inputs, unusual runtime states, partial failures, concurrency situations, or environment-dependent behavior.
- Do not change dependency versions, build tooling, infrastructure, test semantics, or formatting configuration unless explicitly necessary.
- Do not perform broad refactors, redesigns, or "cleanups" that increase risk.
- Do not make speculative improvements.
- Do not remove code unless you can justify that it is provably redundant and behavior-preserving.

Definition of success:
The resulting code must be behaviorally equivalent to the original for all possible inputs and environments. The only allowed changes are internal simplifications that preserve exact semantics.

Working method:
1. First, inspect the codebase carefully and identify only low-risk simplification opportunities.
2. Prioritize:
   - obvious duplication,
   - repeated logic that can be safely unified,
   - overly verbose but equivalent constructions,
   - language-idiomatic simplifications that do not alter semantics,
   - dead-simple extract/helper opportunities that preserve conventions.
3. For every proposed change, assume there is hidden business logic unless you can prove otherwise.
4. Prefer the smallest safe change over the cleverest change.
5. Preserve naming style, file organization style, error-handling style, and existing abstractions.
6. Do not change function signatures or call patterns unless they are purely internal and provably behavior-preserving.
7. Be especially careful with:
   - null/none/nil/undefined handling,
   - truthiness differences,
   - short-circuit behavior,
   - mutation and aliasing,
   - evaluation order,
   - exception/error behavior,
   - async/concurrency behavior,
   - resource cleanup,
   - floating-point behavior,
   - integer overflow/underflow semantics,
   - string/encoding behavior,
   - locale/timezone/date behavior,
   - environment variables and platform-specific behavior,
   - logging and metrics side effects,
   - caching/memoization,
   - lazy vs eager evaluation,
   - reflection, macros, metaprogramming, decorators, annotations, generics, templates, and inheritance,
   - serialization/deserialization formats.
8. If there is any meaningful doubt that a simplification is perfectly safe, do not apply it.
9. When choosing where to inspect first, prefer files or areas changed recently, but only if doing so does not reduce confidence or cause you to miss safer opportunities elsewhere.

Execution rules:
- Work incrementally.
- Make a small number of high-confidence changes rather than many risky ones.
- After each change, reason explicitly about why behavior is unchanged.
- Prefer local refactors over cross-cutting refactors.
- Preserve comments unless they become inaccurate; if you update comments, keep intent unchanged.
- Preserve test coverage and add tests only if needed to lock down existing behavior, not to redefine it.

Output format:
For each proposed or applied change, provide:
1. A short title.
2. Why the original code is more complex or duplicated than necessary.
3. Why the new version is behaviorally equivalent.
4. Any risks or edge cases considered.
5. The exact patch or rewritten code.

Mandatory safety check before finalizing:
Before presenting the final result, perform a strict self-review and reject any change that could possibly alter:
- public behavior,
- edge-case handling,
- side effects,
- ordering,
- error semantics,
- performance characteristics in a way that could affect observable behavior.

If a change is not provably safe, do not include it.

Decision policy:
- When choosing between "more simplified" and "more certain to preserve behavior," always choose certainty.
- When choosing between "more idiomatic" and "more aligned with existing project conventions," always choose existing conventions.
- When unsure, keep the original code.

Continuation rule:
- Keep iterating on additional small, high-confidence simplifications after each successful change.
- Only stop when you have positively determined that no further simplifications are provably safe under the constraints above.
- Do not stop just because you already made a few good changes; continue searching for more safe opportunities until the remaining candidates are meaningfully risky, behaviorally uncertain, or too trivial to justify touching.
- When you stop, explicitly state that you searched for more candidates and rejected the remaining ones as not provably safe.

Final instruction:
Be conservative, precise, and skeptical. Your job is not to improve the design. Your job is to simplify implementation details only where semantic equivalence is extremely likely and defensible."""

    runs against the copy, a no-op or failed rung never leaves a partial
    mutation behind in durable history: either the whole operation lands or none

    tightening the budget across retries — and the proactive caller is happy with
    partial progress.

    ``allow_turn_drop``/``allow_tool_drop``/``allow_emergency`` gate the lossy
    rungs (dropping conversation turns, dropping tool schemas, deterministic
    truncation). The proactive path disables all three so it never destroys
